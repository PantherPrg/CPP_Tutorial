# CPP_TASK_0: Tutorial
** difficulty: 1/10 **|
------------------------|

Welcome! This is your first task. Since you're new to this format of programming, we have to learn. This format is used in competitions, and don't worry, it's not anything too complicated. 
<br />***All of your work should be in the "workplace.cpp" file.***

The input and output and files, so we have to read and write to these files. 

The input file will always be called **"input.in"**, and the output **"output.out"**.

We can include the **fstream** library but it's already included for you.

**OPEN the input stream:**|
--------------------------|
```c++
ifstream ipt("input.in"); // (you can replace ipt with whatever you want, it's just a name)
```

**OPEN the output stream:**|
---------------------------|
```c++
ofstream opt("output.out"); // (same with opt)
```

**TAKING IN INPUT:**|
--------------------|
```c++
ipt >> variable; // (this'll take in the next "value" by space in your file)
```

**PUTTING OUT OUTPUT:**|
-----------------------|
```c++
opt << variable; // (this'll add onto the output file)
```

**Task** |

You will be given four words, and output those same words on separate lines.

**Input**:   
"

**Output**:  
"  
panther  
programming  
pumpkin  
pumpernickel  
"

This problem deals with inputs and outputs. Pretty cool. **Do research, google is your friend.**

For additional help, either ask Paul or Joshua for assistance. We'll go over any questions during the club. **It can be an anonymous request if you would like.**
